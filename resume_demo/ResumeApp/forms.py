# A widget is Djangoâ€™s representation of an HTML input element.
# The widget handles the rendering of the HTML, and the extraction of data from a

# need to explicitly define the widget we want to assign to a field.

# contact details to display contact in html page
class ContactForm(forms.ModelForm):

    # reason 'name' field's max length is 100 as in modelform of ContactProfile, name is set to 100 likewise others.
    # we are not using 'class': 'form-control' inside our widget declaration as we are not using it in our templates
